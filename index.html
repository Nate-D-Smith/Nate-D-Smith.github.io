      <h1>Terrorism In The Sahel</h1>
      <h2>Introduction to the Sahel</h2>
      <p>The Sahel is a region in Africa where the Sahara Desert and the 
        Sudanian Savanna meet. The climate is very hot and dry and food is 
        scarce. The people who inhabit the Sahel have always had difficulties
        with finding food and water due to this climate. Because of this many 
        of the people who inhabit the area are nomadic pastoralists such as 
        the Tuareg and Fulani ethnic groups. These groups have very often been 
        oppressed and discriminated against by the southern peoples of the 
        Sahel. In recent history, many of These people have turned to terrorism
        as a means of overcoming their oppression.
      </p>
      <p>In the West, when we think of terorism, we usually think of groups like 
        ISIS and al-Qaeda and countries like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. While
        it is true that these countries and groups were once the global hotspot for 
        terrorism, we have not shifted our perception of the issue even as the 
        location of the issue has shifted. In the past 5 years, it has become 
        clear that the Sahel is the new epicenter of global terrorism.
      </p>
      <h2>The Sahel: The New Epicenter of Global Terrorism</h2>

      <p>In 2024, militant groups in the Sahel were responsible for more terrorism 
        related deaths than the rest of the world combined! These 3,885 victims 
        were killed by groups such as Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM),
        Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP), Boko Haram, Ansaru, and Islamic State West 
        Africa Province.</p>

      <p>Each group has different motives, ideologies, and methods, and each country 
        has its own culture, struggles, and conter-terrorism strategies. Though there 
        are dozens of deadly groups in the Sahel each with their own impact on the 
        regional security crisis, we will focus on JNIM, ISSP, and Boko Haram. </p>

      <p>In 2024, 5 of the 10 countries most impacted by terrorism globally were in 
        the Sahel. These are Burkina Faso (1), Mali (4), Niger (5), Nigeria (6), and
        Cameroon (10). Though all 5 of thsese countries have suffered significantly
        from terrorism, we will focus on Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. These 3 
        countries share many similarities including the existential nature of the 
        terror threat, their shared French colonial heritage, and the relationship 
        between their military junta governments.
