      <h1>Terrorism In The Sahel</h1>
      <h2>Introduction to the Sahel</h2>
      <p>The Sahel is a region in Africa where the Sahara Desert and the 
        Sudanian Savanna meet. The climate is very hot and dry and food is 
        scarce. The people who inhabit the Sahel have always had difficulties
        with finding food and water due to this climate. Because of this many 
        of the people who inhabit the area are nomadic pastoralists such as 
        the Tuareg and Fulani ethnic groups. These groups have very often been 
        oppressed and discriminated against by the southern peoples of the 
        Sahel. In recent history, many of These people have turned to terrorism
        as a means of overcoming their oppression.
      </p>
      <p>In the West, when we think of terorism, we usually think of groups like 
        ISIS and al-Qaeda and countries like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. While
        it is true that these countries and groups were once the global hotspot for 
        terrorism, we have not shifted our perception of the issue even as the 
        location of the issue has shifted. In the past 5 years, it has become 
        clear that the Sahel is the new epicenter of global terrorism.
      </p>
      <h2>The Sahel: The New Epicenter of Global Terrorism</h2>

      <p>In 2024, militant groups in the Sahel were responsible for more terrorism 
        related deaths than the rest of the world combined! These 3,885 victims 
        were killed by groups such as Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM),
        Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP), Boko Haram, Ansaru, and Islamic State West 
        Africa Province.</p>

      <p>Each group has different motives, ideologies, and methods, and each country 
        has its own culture, struggles, and conter-terrorism strategies. Though there 
        are dozens of deadly groups in the Sahel each with their own impact on the 
        regional security crisis, we will focus on JNIM, ISSP, and Boko Haram. </p>

      <p>In 2024, 5 of the 10 countries most impacted by terrorism globally were in 
        the Sahel. These are Burkina Faso (1), Mali (4), Niger (5), Nigeria (6), and
        Cameroon (10). Though all 5 of thsese countries have suffered significantly
        from terrorism, we will focus on Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. These 3 
        countries share many similarities including the existential nature of the 
        terror threat, their shared French colonial heritage, and the relationship 
        between their governments. All three countries are engaged in a constant 
        battle with both JNIM and ISSP and have lost control of large amounts of land
        to them. These countries also all have histories of weak governments. Since 
        they were given independence, there have been 5 successful coups in Mali, 6
        in Niger and 8 in Burkina Faso.</p>

      <p>The most recent string of coups from 2021-2023 have left military juntas in 
        control of each country. These new leaders have made a lot of mistakes that
        just made the issue even worse for their citizens. Firstly, they all left the
        Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS) and created a new alliance 
        called the Alliance of Sahel States. The juntas of the alliance claim that they 
        can deal with the terrorist groups and that they don't need help fro the West.
        In 2022 they kicked out the French and hired Russian mercenaries formerly known 
        as Wagner and now called the Africa Corp. These soldiers have suffered heavy 
        losses over the last few years and have not been effective against Jihadist 
        groups. Niger and Burkina Faso have been riddled with attacks and Mali is on 
        the brink of being taken over by JNIM.
