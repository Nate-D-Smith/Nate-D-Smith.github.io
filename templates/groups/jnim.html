        <h1>Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction and foundation</h2>
        <p>Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) is a Salafi Jihadist militant organisation operating in the Sahel 
        region of sub-Saharan Africa. It was created in 2017 as a merger of 
        4 salafi-jihadist organizations in the sahel (including AQIM) and has 
        since opperated as a sub-group of al-Qaeda.</p> 

        <p>The ranks of JNIM total 6,000 troops mainly from the Tuareg and Fulani 
        ethnic groups in Mali. It operates in both Arabic and French but curent 
        leaders prefer Arabic. The curent leader and founder of JNIM is Iyad Ag 
        Ghaly, a Tuareg militant who has fought in various rebellions since the 
        1980s. He was the founder and leader of the former militant group Ansar 
        Dine and became the leader of JNIM upon it's creation.</p>
        
        <h2>Ideology and methods</h2>
        <p>JNIM follows a strict version of salafism which is a fundamentalist
        movement within Sunni Islam that emphasises the purity of original
        islamic practices and rejects later innovations and developments.
            It also emphasises the supremacy of the Quran over all other 
            interpretations of the message of the prophet Muhammed. </p>

        <p>Though JNIM is one of the dealiest terrorist groups om the world,
            it often acts as a moderate option compared to Islamic State in 
            the Greater Sahara (ISGS). While ISGS attacks civilians to cause
            fear, JNIM focuses on targeted attacks against state assets and
            personnel. It practices a "hearts and minds" approach acting as 
            a stablizing legal force in areas it controls.
