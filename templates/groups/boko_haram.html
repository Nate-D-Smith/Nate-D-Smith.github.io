        <h1>Boko Haram</h1>

        <h2>Introduction and foundation</h2>
        <p>
        Boko Haram is the common name for a Nigerian Salafi-jihadist insurgency that has operated
        across the Lake Chad Basin since the early 2000s. The movement emerged in northeastern Nigeria
        around the preacher Mohammed Yusuf, developing from a religious community into an armed group
        after violent clashes with state security forces in 2009. Following Yusuf’s death in custody,
        the insurgency reorganized under Abubakar Shekau and expanded rapidly, launching attacks on
        civilians, government targets, and regional militaries.
        </p>

        <p>
        While the group is often described as a single organization, “Boko Haram” has functioned as a
        shifting ecosystem of factions. A major split occurred in 2016 when the Islamic State recognized
        a rival leadership aligned with the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), leaving Shekau’s
        faction (often called JAS) increasingly isolated. After Shekau’s death in 2021, ISWAP consolidated
        influence across many areas of the Lake Chad theater, but violence remains fluid, with defections,
        splinter groups, and local commanders shaping the conflict.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Ideology and methods</h2>
        <p>
        Boko Haram’s ideology is rooted in a militant Salafi-jihadist worldview that rejects secular
        governance and seeks to impose strict religious rule. The movement frames the Nigerian state
        and its institutions as illegitimate and targets state symbols, security forces, and communities
        viewed as collaborating with the government. Over time, this ideology has been reinforced by
        regional grievances, heavy-handed counterinsurgency responses, and economic hardship across the
        northeast.
        </p>

        <p>
        Tactically, Boko Haram became notorious for mass-casualty bombings, raids on villages, abductions,
        and forced recruitment. The insurgency has also relied on intimidation and coercion to control
        mobility and extract resources. Compared to the Sahelian jihadist model (such as JNIM), Boko Haram’s
        most extreme phases emphasized spectacular violence against civilians; however, ISWAP has often
        pursued a more structured governance and military-focused approach, targeting security forces and
        attempting to regulate local populations to sustain long-term control.
        </p>

        <h2>Regional Impact and Current Trajectory</h2>
        <p>
        Boko Haram has been one of Africa’s most destructive insurgencies, producing large-scale displacement,
        regional militarization, and long-term humanitarian crises. The conflict has destabilized border areas
        of Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon, turning the Lake Chad Basin into a persistent zone of insecurity.
        In Niger, the Diffa region has been particularly vulnerable, facing repeated attacks on villages,
        security posts, and critical infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
        Today, the Lake Chad conflict is shaped by factional competition, cross-border military pressure, and
        shifting local alliances. ISWAP remains a central actor, leveraging mobility around Lake Chad and
        exploiting gaps in state control, while smaller splinter factions continue to carry out raids and
        intimidation. Even as leadership structures change, Boko Haram’s legacy endures through disrupted
        livelihoods, weakened institutions, and a security environment where violence can surge rapidly when
        state presence recedes.
