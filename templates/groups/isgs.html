        <h1>Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS)</h1>

        <h2>Introduction and foundation</h2>
        <p>
        The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) is a Salafi-jihadist militant 
        organization operating primarily in the tri-border region of Mali, Niger, 
        and Burkina Faso. The group emerged in 2015 as a splinter faction from 
        al-Mourabitoun under the leadership of Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi and 
        formally pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2016. ISGS was 
        subsequently recognized by the Islamic State’s central leadership as 
        part of its global network.
        </p>

        <p>
        ISGS draws much of its manpower from Fulani and other Sahelian communities 
        affected by insecurity, marginalization, and state absence. The group 
        initially operated as a relatively small mobile force but rapidly expanded 
        its operational tempo after 2018, becoming one of the deadliest actors in 
        the Sahel. Following the death of al-Sahrawi in 2021, ISGS has continued to 
        function through decentralized command structures aligned with Islamic 
        State’s broader West African strategy.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Ideology and methods</h2>
        <p>
        ISGS adheres to the Islamic State’s uncompromising interpretation of 
        Salafi-jihadism, emphasizing strict takfir (excommunication), territorial 
        conquest, and the use of extreme violence as a tool of governance. The group 
        rejects compromise with local authorities and views populations that do not 
        submit to its rule as legitimate targets. Loyalty to the Islamic State’s 
        caliphate project remains central to ISGS’s identity and operational logic.
        </p>

        <p>
        Unlike JNIM’s more pragmatic “hearts and minds” approach, ISGS relies heavily 
        on mass-casualty attacks, village massacres, and collective punishment to 
        assert control. Civilians, militias, and rival jihadist groups are frequently 
        targeted to eliminate resistance and intimidate surrounding communities. 
        ISGS has focused much of its violence on rural areas, exploiting weak state 
        presence to establish zones of coercive dominance.
        </p>

        <h2>Regional Impact and Current Trajectory</h2>
        <p>
        ISGS has played a central role in transforming the Sahel into one of the 
        world’s most lethal theaters of jihadist violence. Its expansion across 
        western Niger, northern Burkina Faso, and eastern Mali has resulted in 
        large-scale civilian displacement, village destruction, and persistent 
        insecurity. The group’s rivalry with JNIM has further intensified violence, 
        with clashes between the two jihadist camps adding an additional layer of 
        instability to already fragile regions.
        </p>

        <p>
        Strategically, ISGS prioritizes territorial control and population 
        subjugation over political negotiation or gradual infiltration. While this 
        approach has generated rapid gains in some areas, it has also provoked 
        sustained military pressure and local resistance. Despite leadership losses 
        and counterterrorism operations, ISGS remains a highly adaptive and dangerous 
        actor whose continued presence shapes the security dynamics of the central 
        Sahel.
