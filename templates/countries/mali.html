      <h1>Mali</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Mali is a country in the Sahel that has thousands of years 
        of legendary history ranging from the conquests of the Mali 
        empire to the conquests of Islam and from the glorious reign 
        of history's richest man Mansa Musa to the oppressive reign of 
        post colonial military juntas. Over it's history, Mali has
        served as a melting pot of ethnic groups, religions, languages, 
        philosophies, and ideologies. The combination of these things 
        has created one of the most interesting and chaotic cultures
        of our day.</p>

      <p>Mali has been at the heart of the Sahel's security crisis 
        for more than a decade. What began as a local rebellion in 
        2012 has evolved into a complex conflict involving jihadist 
        groups, ethnic militias, international forces, and state 
        actors. Today, Mali is the most active theater of jihadist 
        violence in the Sahel and the birthplace of several groups 
        that now operate across West Africa.</p>

      <h2>Militant Groups and Violence</h2>

      <p>The primary among these is Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin 
        or JNIM which is a Jihadist militant group born out of the 
        Northern Tuareg rebellions and currently allied with al-Qaeda. It has ravaged the 
        Northern regions of Mali since 2017 with bombings, executions,
        theft, and armed raids. In spite of this violence JNIM has 
        earned the respect and loyalty of many groups in Mali's border
        regions, especially among ethnic Turareg and Fulani tribes 
        who have been historically oppressed by the state. It
        concentrates most of it's attacks on state government and 
        military assets in order to delegitimize the state. JNIM also 
        has conducted hundreds of attacks against the Islamic State
        Sahel Province (ISSP) with whom it competes for control of 
        the tri-border region of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. 
        Mali civialians often get caught up in the crossfire as groups
        frequently massacre villages who are seen as friendly to the 
        ennemy.</p>

      <p>Mali has long been riddled by violence. Mali was invaded and 
        controled by France as part of Afrique Occidentale Francaise 
        from 1893 until its independence in 1960. French colonial rule
        involved harsh administration including forced labor, heavy
        taxation, and forced military recruitment. Since independence
        in 1960, there has been nonstop chaos due to totalitarian
        regimes, ethnic cleansing, Islamic fundamentalism, and 
        repeated coups. There
