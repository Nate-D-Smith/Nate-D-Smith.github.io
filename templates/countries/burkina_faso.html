      <h1>Burkina Faso</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in the heart of the Sahel, shaped by a long history of
        trade routes, powerful pre-colonial kingdoms, and diverse communities spread across savanna
        and semi-arid borderlands. Since independence from France in 1960, the country has experienced
        repeated periods of political turbulence, including revolutionary rule, long one-party dominance,
        and multiple military takeovers. Burkina Faso’s modern identity has been forged through intense
        debates over governance, national unity, and the balance between tradition and modernization.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last decade, Burkina Faso has become one of the central battlegrounds of the Sahel’s
        security crisis. Violence that began as a spillover from northern Mali evolved into a nationwide
        insurgency, with attacks spreading from the northern and eastern borders toward the country’s
        interior. As armed groups expanded, civilian displacement surged, local economies fractured, and
        the state struggled to maintain control beyond major urban centers.
      </p>

      <h2>Militant Groups and Violence</h2>

      <p>
        The primary drivers of jihadist violence in Burkina Faso are networks aligned with al-Qaeda and
        the Islamic State. Al-Qaeda–linked forces (most commonly associated with JNIM’s broader coalition)
        have built influence through rural intimidation, selective violence, and efforts to undermine state
        legitimacy—especially in areas where communities feel neglected or abused by security forces.
        Competing Islamic State–aligned factions (often operating through Sahel-based formations) have also
        carried out mass-casualty raids, ambushes, and attacks on security posts, particularly across the
        northern and eastern corridors. The rivalry between these camps has intensified insecurity, with
        civilians frequently punished for perceived collaboration, and entire villages targeted or forced to flee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Burkina Faso’s crisis is not only a story of militant expansion, but also of governance breakdown and
        communal vulnerability. Long-standing disputes over land, herding routes, and local authority have been
        exploited by armed actors, while cycles of retaliation have fueled militia formation and deepened mistrust.
        As the conflict escalated, the country experienced repeated political upheavals and shifts in security strategy,
        leaving many regions caught between insurgent pressure and an overstretched state response. Today, Burkina Faso
        faces one of the most severe humanitarian and security emergencies in West Africa.
