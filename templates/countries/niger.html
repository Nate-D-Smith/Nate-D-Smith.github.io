      <h1>Niger</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Niger is a vast, landlocked country in the central Sahel, defined by desert expanses, 
        trans-Saharan trade routes, and a population concentrated along the Niger River and 
        southern agricultural zones. Historically, Niger served as a crossroads for commerce, 
        migration, and Islamic scholarship, while colonial rule under France reshaped political 
        authority and borders. Since independence in 1960, Niger has faced recurring governance 
        challenges, military interventions in politics, and persistent development constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the past decade, Niger has become a critical front in the Sahel’s security crisis. 
        Pressured simultaneously from the west by jihadist groups operating in Mali and Burkina Faso 
        and from the southeast by Boko Haram–linked factions around Lake Chad, Niger occupies a 
        uniquely exposed position. Despite maintaining relatively cohesive state institutions, 
        the country has struggled to contain the spread of armed violence across its vast and 
        lightly governed territories.
      </p>

      <h2>Militant Groups and Violence</h2>

      <p>
        Jihadist violence in Niger is primarily driven by two distinct theaters. In the western 
        regions, particularly Tillabéri and Tahoua, Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP) and 
        al-Qaeda–aligned elements linked to JNIM conduct attacks against military forces, local 
        officials, and civilian communities. These groups exploit porous borders and rural 
        grievances, frequently launching cross-border operations that blur the line between 
        national conflicts in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the southeast, the Diffa region has been heavily affected by violence associated with 
        Boko Haram and its splinter factions operating around Lake Chad. Attacks in this zone often 
        target villages, security posts, and economic infrastructure, producing chronic displacement 
        and humanitarian strain. Although Niger has avoided complete territorial collapse, the 
        combination of multi-front jihadist pressure, limited resources, and political instability 
        has made it one of the most strategically significant—and vulnerable—states in the Sahel.
